## About The Game

"My Awesome Space Shooter Game" is a fast-paced arcade experience. Pilot your spaceship, dodge and shoot down waves of incoming asteroids, and manage your lives. The game features dynamic difficulty, power-ups, and adaptive controls for both desktop and mobile platforms.

## Features

* **Responsive Controls:** Seamless control via mouse on desktop or an intuitive virtual joystick on mobile devices.
* **Dynamic Asteroid Spawning:** Asteroids appear with increasing frequency and speed as the game progresses.
* **Laser Blasts:** Shoot lasers to destroy asteroids.
* **Life System:** Manage your spaceship's health with a fixed number of lives.
* **Life Pickups:** Collect special items to regain lost lives.
* **Visual Feedback:** Experience screenshake and explosion animations upon impact.
* **Game Over Screen:** A clear "Game Over" display with a restart option.
* **Main Menu:** A starting point for your game (assuming you have one, if not, adjust this).
* **Background Music:** Engaging music for the game over screen (if enabled).

## How to Play

### Desktop Controls

* **Move Spaceship:** Move your mouse horizontally to control the spaceship's X-position.
* **Shoot Laser:** Left-click the mouse to fire lasers.

### Mobile Controls

* **Move Spaceship:** Use the virtual joystick located in the bottom-left corner of the screen. Drag the knob to move your spaceship horizontally.
